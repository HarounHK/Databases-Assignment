Read through the dataset and decided what tables will be created. Developed a logial model of these tables and chose a primary and foreign key for each. Developed approapriate relationships between the tables.
Developed a Relational Model then developed code using the relational model. Dropped and created eachof these tables and inserted data into them. Ran multiple different types scripts including basic queries, 
sub-queries, set operating queries and join/aggregate functions to test what was learned throughout the module.
